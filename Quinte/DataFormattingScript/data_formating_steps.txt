1. format edm_vitals
2. format nur_vitals
3. combine all vitals based on patient, date/time
4. analyze lactate and wbc count to see if overtime, data for 1 patient changes, if no statistically significant change (250 sepsis patients),
then reduce file to 1 number per patient. Otherwise, tbd
5. combine lactate and wbc with vitals
6. figure out how we can answer the research problem(s) and combine all data previously processed with sepsis data
